        <p>Bees tend to work in an orderly society where collaboration is key. Here at The Colony, that is no different.</p>
        <p>The Colony is a web-design consultancy team based in Manchester, made up of 5 unique and talented individuals, each with strengths in a number of different areas of web-design.     Whether it is a project from the very start or a specific stage of web-design, we can help.</p>
        <p>The process we will follow starts with initial consultations and planning of content and layout. Next will come the design and coding of the site, followed by User Experience (UX) research and testing to ensure the product we design suits your user's needs.</p>
        <p>Please see our <a href="">Website</a> for further details.</p>
